## What's Wrong with Formal Proofs?

It's generally accepted that mathematicans don't like using proof assistants. Although there are [amazing mathematicans who do](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/), they're very much the minority. Designers of proof assistants are generally not mathematicians (and vice versa), so there's unfortunately not much data on this lack of interest. I don't have an overarching theory of the current gap between formal proofs and natural proofs, but here's some datapoints I've gathered after talking with mathematicians about the issue. This post is targeted towards designers of proof assistants.
