title: Advice for formalists
---

> Math is a puzzle-solving activity, and like most other kinds of puzzles the best strategies require **thinking outside of the puzzle's own rules**.

> Many avoid mathematical intuition due to fear. When we bind ourselves to the strict rules of a game, its easy to blame the rules for our failures. We can say "the game does not allow me to do this" and give up. When we stop restricting ourselves though, we have no one to blame but ourselves.

> Being **explicit** and being **rigorous** are two very different things.

> Formalism exists to make math **explicit**, it does not by itself make math more **rigorous**.

> My math education was a little odd in that the first few years of it were almost exclusively through a **proof assistant**. Formalists -- who are the target of this post -- will almost certainly be familiar with proof assistants, but I will briefly cover them for the sake of everyone else.

> A proof assistant is a software package that implements a mathematical foundation. Most mathematicians are familiar with classical set theory, there is a proof assistant called **Mizar** which implements it. Mizar provides
